# Generative Models

Implementation of famous models for self-study

## Autoencoders
* feedforward (MNIST)
* convolutional (MNIST)
* residual (MNIST)
* variational (MNIST, CIFAR)
* beta-variational (MNIST)
* convolutional with perceptual loss (MNIST)

## GANs
* GAN (MNIST)
* DCGAN (MNIST)

## References
[https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN] and
[https://github.com/lyeoni/pytorch-mnist-GAN] were very helpful in understanding
how the mathematics of GANs translated to code; as well as providing good
initial hyperparameters and architectures
